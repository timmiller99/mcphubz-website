# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Latest Directives and Norms

## Current Specification

The latest MCP specification is version **2024-11-05**, which defines the authoritative protocol requirements. This specification outlines the standardized way for applications to:

- Share contextual information with language models
- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems
- Build composable integrations and workflows

## Key Security Principles

The MCP specification emphasizes several important security and trust principles:

1. **User Consent and Control**
   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations
   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken
   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers
   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent
   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls

3. **Tool Safety**
   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate caution
   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool
   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use

4. **LLM Sampling Controls**
   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests
   - Users should control whether sampling occurs, the actual prompt, and what results the server can see
   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts

## Implementation Best Practices

According to the latest directives, MCP implementors should:

1. **Security Measures**
   - Use TLS encryption for remote connections
   - Verify all connection origins
   - Sanitize inputs and messages
   - Configure appropriate access controls

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Set timeouts for operations to prevent delays
   - Use progress tokens for long-running tasks
   - Monitor resource usage and message flow
   - Enable incremental progress updates

3. **Error Management**
   - Validate inputs with type-safe schemas
   - Handle errors using standard error codes
   - Keep detailed logs of protocol events
   - Track message flow and performance metrics

## Current Ecosystem Trends

The MCP ecosystem is evolving with several notable trends:

1. **Growing Adoption**
   - Development tools like Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have integrated MCP
   - Companies like Block are using MCP to create systems that handle repetitive tasks

2. **Expanding Server Ecosystem**
   - Pre-built MCP servers are available for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer
   - The official repository contains both reference implementations and community-built servers

3. **Integration with Claude**
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet is adept at quickly building MCP server implementations
   - All Claude.ai plans support connecting MCP servers to the Claude Desktop app
   - Claude for Work customers can test MCP servers locally, connecting Claude to internal systems and datasets

4. **Standardization of Communication**
   - MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages to establish communication between hosts, clients, and servers
   - The protocol follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers

## Future Directions

Based on current trends, MCP is moving toward:

1. **Expanded Enterprise Integration**
   - More pre-built connectors for enterprise systems
   - Developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers

2. **Enhanced Security Features**
   - More robust consent and authorization flows
   - Improved access controls and data protections

3. **Broader Ecosystem Support**
   - Growing community of developers contributing to open-source repositories
   - Increased adoption across different AI platforms and tools
